# TestExec
A minimalist functional test sequencer/test executive library for sibling project TestPlan.
   
  Sibling project TestPlan is both a demonstration program and a functional test of TestExec.
  
  TestExec is always current; its repository is the master for ABT's developing production test sequencer.
