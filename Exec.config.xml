  <!-- BarCodeScannerID is the identifier used to find & claim the Barcode Scanner used in class SerialNumberDialog.
        When a TestExec's App.config LOGGER_SerialNumberDialogEnabled = true:
				- Class SerialNumberDialog is the Barcode Scanning method for prompting test operators for UUT Serial Numbers.
				- SerialNumberDialog exclusively enforces Serial Number entry via Barcode Scanning of ABT's official Code39 encoded Serial Number.
          - This enforces correct Barcode Scanning of ABT Serial Numbers, unlike hand-typing them, with it's substantially higher error rates..
				When a TestExec's App.config LOGGER_SerialNumberDialogEnabled = false:
				- An Interaction.InputBox prompts test operator to enter ABT Serial Numbers.
          - This permits both Barcode Scanning *and* manual keyboard entry of Serial Numbers (hand typing), with its concommitant high rate of typographic errors.
           
        NOTE:  Barcode Scanner must be a corded USB scanner, and must also be explicitly supported by Microsoft's Windows.Devices.PointOfService namespace.
        - List of supported scanners at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/devices-sensors/pos-device-support.
				NOTE:  Barcode Scanner must be programmed into USB HID mode to work correctly with TestExec's SerialNumberDialog class to read ABT Serial Numbers.
              - For a Voyager 1200g, scan PAP131 label from "Honeywell Voyager 1200G User's Guide ReadMe.pdf" to program into USB HID mode.
              - Both "ReadMe" & "User's Guides" documents reside in Logging folder for convenience.
        NOTE:  Barcode Scanner must also be programmed to read the Code39 Barcode Symbology of ABT's Serial Numbers.

  <SerialNumberRegExDefault>^01BB2-[0-9]{5}$</SerialNumberRegExDefault>
  <!-- SerialNumberRegExDefault is the default global Regular Expression an ABT Serial Number is validated against in TestExec.
                
         NOTE:  SerialNumberRegExDefault can be locally overridden by a TestExec App.config's UUT_SerialNumberRegExCustom key/value pair.
         - As Customers sometimes require Serial Number formats that differ from ABT's (or formats that differ even from one Customer UUT to another)
           SerialNumberRegExDefault is customizable to any/every UUT tested.
         - When not overridden by an App.config's UUT_SerialNumberRegExCustom, SerialNumberRegExDefault is applied instead.
         
         NOTE:  ABT's official Serial Number format is "01BB2-#####", where each "#" is an is an integer in the set {0..9}.
         - This allows for only 100,000 unique Serial Numbers overall, but those 100,000 are specifically associated to their UUT.
         - Thus each UUT can have only 100,000 unique Serial Numbers.
         - Obviously, if ABT builds more than 100,000 of any specific UUT, they're in trouble.
         
         NOTE:  Regular Expression ^01BB2-[0-9]{5}$ enforces Serial Numbers that match ABT's Serial Number format of "01BB2-#####".
         - 01BB2-01234 & 01BB2-56789 are thus valid ABT Serial Numbers.
         - 01234 is invalid, as it lacks the "01BB2-" prefix.
         - 01BB2-1234 is invalid, as it lacks 5 digits after the "01BB2-" prefix.
         - 01BB2-O1234 is invalid, as "O1234" ≠ "01234" as "O" ≠ "0".

	InstrumentsStationary:
  - List all stationary/permanently installed instruments for this test system.
    - Each TestPlan's app.config file lists its necessary/required instruments.
    - These can be instruments listed in below InstrumentsStationary element.
    - TestPlans also allow for portable/temporarily installed instruments if necessary/required.
	- For instrument calibration or replacement, swap identical InstrumentStationary with others, then update Address.
	- For deletions, remove InstrumentStationary element.
  - For additions, add InstrumentStationary element.
    - Add a new driver to ABT.Test.Exec.InstrumentDrivers.* if needed.

	ID:			- Required element.
					- Unique Identifier; no 2 can be identical, as ID is unique key in a Dictionary object.
	Detail:	- Required element.
						- Concise description of Instrument.
						- Recommend convention of Manufacturer, Model, Input/Output quantity if applicable, and Instrument type.
							- Keysight E36103B Single Output DC Power Supply
							- Keysight E36234A Dual Output DC Power Supply
							- Keysight 34461A Digital Multi-Meter
	Address: - Required element.
						- Address elements must also all be unique, no duplicates.
						- They must also be valid VISA instrument addresses.
						- VISA instrument addresses are easily determined using Keysight's Connection Expert app
							- https://www.keysight.com/us/en/assets/7018-03222/data-sheets/5990-9362.pdf.
							- Example VISA address for USB instrument: USB0::0x2A8D::0x1602::MY61001983::0::INSTR.
	ClassName:  Required element.
							- Class name from ABT.Test.Exec.InstrumentDrivers.*
							- This is the instrument driver, typically inherited from a manufacturer provided SCPI or IVI driver.
							- The inheritance permits adding custom methods and interfaces, most quite simple, but useful.
              - Note that instruments may have multiple drivers; SCPI, IVI-C, IVI-COM & IVI.Net are common Keysight provided drivers.
                - SCPI drivers are likely more familiar, being very similar to native SCPI, but IVI drivers be advantageous.
                - Regardless which, TestPlan developers should utilize their preferred instrument driver.
                - If absent from TestExec's ABT.Test.Exec.InstrumentDrivers.*, can utilize preferred drivers 
                  as InstrumentPortableRequired, with driver being installed locally with the TestPlan.
                  - Consider adding to TestExec's ABT.Test.Exec.InstrumentDrivers.* when convenient.
